# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

An Electron desktop GUI for coding agents. Claude sessions run through `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`; Codex sessions run through `@openai/codex-sdk`. Both live in the Electron main process, reuse the user's existing provider login, and operate in whatever project folder the user picks.

## Commands

```sh
npm run dev        # run the app in dev mode (electron-vite, hot reload)
npm run build      # production build to out/
npm run typecheck  # tsc over both projects: tsconfig.node.json (main+preload) and tsconfig.web.json (renderer)
npm test           # node --test over test/*.test.ts (Node strips the TS types natively)
```

`npm run typecheck` is the primary verification gate. There is no linter. Tests are
minimal and cover only pure, tricky logic worth pinning (e.g. `test/imageScan.test.ts`
for Codex generated-image discovery) — most code is verified by typecheck + running the app.
When you extract such logic, keep it dependency-free (import only `node:*`) so `node --test`
can run the `.ts` directly without a bundler.

Dev utilities (env vars for `npm run dev`, used for UI iteration without a human clicking):
- `AIGUI_CAPTURE=/tmp/shot.png` — saves a window screenshot after load. `AIGUI_CAPTURE_DELAY=2000,8000` takes a comma list of delays and saves `shot-1.png`, `shot-2.png`, …
- `AIGUI_E2E='<js>'` — runs a script in the renderer after load and logs the result to the terminal.
- `CARBON_UPDATE_REPO=owner/repo` — points the update check at another repo, so a real
  "newer release" can be faked (any repo whose latest tag outranks `package.json`).
- `CARBON_FAKE_HOMEBREW=1` — forces `installedViaHomebrew`, the only way to reach the
  cask variant of the update UI outside an actual `brew install`. Dev-only; a packaged
  build ignores it.
- Renderer console output is mirrored to the terminal in dev.

## Distribution and updates

Auto-update is impossible while the app is unsigned, and not for the reason people
assume: `build/adhoc-sign.cjs` gives every build a designated requirement of
`cdhash H"…"` — a hash of *that one build* — so Squirrel.Mac's check that an update
matches the installed app can never pass. It's the signature, not the feed. Fixing it
costs an Apple Developer ID ($99/yr); the release layout here is already what
`electron-updater` wants, so that day changes the client and nothing else.

The Homebrew cask is therefore the one route that updates in place, and
`installedViaHomebrew` (`main/updates.ts`) is what lets the update banner say so —
`brew upgrade --cask carbon` instead of a download. It keys on
`<brew prefix>/Caskroom/carbon/<running version>`: matching the *version*, not just the
token, keeps the answer honest when someone brew-installs and then builds a newer copy
over the top. Every failure mode is a false negative, which is why each check is a hard
requirement rather than one signal among several — the cost is a brew user seeing the
generic banner, where the reverse would tell a non-brew user to run a command that
errors, or a brew user to install a `.dmg` that desynchronizes Homebrew's records.

The cask lives in a second repo, `Achour/homebrew-carbon` (Homebrew requires the
`homebrew-` prefix). `.github/workflows/release.yml` rewrites it on every tag via `sed`
over three anchored lines — `version` and both `sha256`s — followed by `grep`
assertions, because `sed` exits 0 when it matches nothing and would otherwise push a
cask still pointing at the previous release. The step needs a `TAP_DEPLOY_KEY` secret —
the private half of a write-enabled deploy key on the tap, since `github.token` can't
reach another repo — and skips itself without one, so a missing secret never fails a
release. A deploy key rather than a PAT: it is scoped to that single repo, carries no
other permission, and is revoked from the tap's settings instead of an account-wide list.

## Architecture

Three Electron layers with one shared contract:

- `src/shared/types.ts` — **the contract between all three layers.** The `Api` interface (preload bridge), the `ChatEvent` union (main → renderer streaming), message/part types, `MODEL_OPTIONS`, `PERMISSION_MODES`. Most features start here.
- `src/main/` — Electron main process. `index.ts` registers all `ipcMain.handle` channels and emits `ChatEvent`s to the renderer over the single `chat:event` channel. `claude.ts` owns agent sessions. `store.ts` persists chats/settings. `git.ts` / `files.ts` are thin helpers behind the `git:*` / `fs:*` IPC channels.
- `src/preload/` — typed `window.api` bridge (contextIsolation on); a mechanical 1:1 mapping of `Api` methods to `ipcRenderer.invoke` calls.
- `src/renderer/src/` — React app. One zustand store (`store.ts`) holds all UI state; `applyEvent` is the reducer for incoming `ChatEvent`s. Components in `components/`, shadcn-style primitives built on Base UI in `components/ui/`, message renderers in `components/messages/`.

**Adding an IPC method touches four files:** the `Api` interface in `shared/types.ts`, a handler in `main/index.ts`, the bridge entry in `preload/index.ts`, and the caller in the renderer store.

Path aliases: `@` → `src/renderer/src`, `@shared` → `src/shared` (renderer and main both get `@shared`).

### Session flow (`src/main/claude.ts`)

`ChatManager` holds one provider-specific session per active chat. Claude uses one long-lived Agent SDK `query()` input stream. Codex uses SDK `Thread.runStreamed()` turns and resumes the same thread id across turns and app restarts. Both normalize provider events into the shared `ChatEvent` contract.

- Conversations resume across app restarts via `chat.sessionId` (`resume` option); the session id arrives on the SDK `init` message.
- SDK stream events are normalized into `AssistantPart[]` (`text` / `thinking` / `tool`); when the final `assistant` message arrives, `reconcileAssistant` replaces the streamed parts wholesale. Tool results come back on `user` messages and are matched by `toolUseId` via the `toolLoc` map.
- Streaming text deltas are coalesced ~40ms before IPC emission (per-token renders make the UI feel hung).
- Permissions: the SDK's `canUseTool` callback returns a Promise held in a `pending` map until the renderer answers via `chat:respond-permission`. "Always allow" uses the SDK's permission `suggestions`.
- Changing **effort** has no live SDK setter — `setOptions` disposes the session and the next send resumes it in a fresh process. Model and permission mode change live.
- Sub-agent traffic is skipped in the UI: messages with `parent_tool_use_id` are ignored.

### Persistence (`src/main/store.ts`)

SQLite (`node:sqlite`, no native dep) in `userData/chats.db`: a `chats` table of metadata, a `messages` table keyed `(chat_id, seq)` where `seq` is the message's index in `chat.messages`, and a `kv` table (migration marker, deletion tombstones). `settings.json` stays a plain file. `userData` is pinned to `ai-gui` so dev and packaged builds share history (`~/Library/Application Support/ai-gui/`); `AIGUI_USERDATA` overrides it for an isolated instance.

**Chats load lazily, and only a window of each one.** Startup opens the database and reads nothing else — `listChats` is one indexed query over `chats`. Opening a chat hydrates only its most recent messages (`HYDRATE_TAIL` / `HYDRATE_BYTES`, floored by `HYDRATE_MIN`); older slots hold an `unloadedMessage` placeholder so **`seq` keeps meaning "index in `chat.messages`"** for every write pass. `loadOlder` promotes one more window on demand. This is what makes the 36.6 MB chat open in ~5 ms instead of ~37 ms plus a 36.9 MB structured clone.

**No write pass may ever serialize a placeholder** — it is not the message, and writing it would flatten real history. `candidateRows` and `reconcile` both skip `Resident.unloaded` and `Resident.corrupt`, and the sets survive eviction (via `holes`) because a re-admitted chat rebuilds its baseline from scratch and forces a full reconcile. Placeholders are also *in sync with disk by construction* — nothing ever parsed them, so nothing can have mutated them — which is why they count toward neither `unchecked` (durability) nor the `unverified` set. Conflating that with `inexact` (byte accounting) would pin every windowed chat in memory forever, since `evictOverBudget` refuses to evict an unverified chat.

`getChat` returns the full-length array with placeholders — what sessions hold and mutate. `viewChat` returns the loaded suffix plus `hiddenBefore` and is what the renderer gets; a placeholder never crosses IPC. Anything reading a chat from the *front* (only title generation) must check `Store.hiddenBefore` first.

Resident chats are held under a byte budget (`RESIDENT_BUDGET`) with an LRU — measured on the window, not the chat's size on disk. Evicted ones are tracked by `WeakRef` so **there is at most one `ChatData` per id alive in the process** and `getChat` always returns it. That invariant is load-bearing: provider sessions hold `this.chat` for their whole lifetime and mutate it in place.

The last explicitly chosen model/effort/permission-mode become the defaults for new chats (`rememberOptions`).

**Writes are incremental.** `saveChatSoon` (1.5s trailing debounce, 5s cap) re-serializes only the rows that can have changed — appended-since-last-write, the tail, anything holding a live tool, and anything flagged via `markMessageDirty`. `saveChat` (turn boundaries) and a 30s floor run a reconcile against what the database actually holds; that pass never DELETEs rows it lacks in memory. The reconcile is **bounded** — it verifies the tail plus a rotating window (`RECONCILE_VERIFY_BYTES`) rather than re-serializing the whole chat, so a big chat cannot stall the main thread at every turn; the cursor covers everything over successive passes, and quit runs one thorough pass over `dirty` ∪ `unverified` — a chat leaves `dirty` after a bounded pass that may have skipped the very mutation the thorough pass exists to catch, so tracking it separately is what stops that mutation reverting on the next launch. Eviction writes a **thorough** pass for the same reason: it is the last moment the object is guaranteed reachable, and a chat that is only WeakRef-held can be collected before quit ever sees it. `flushAll` on quit writes only chats that were actually mutated.

Two safeguards for the shared-userData design: a per-chat advisory `locks` row (heartbeat, 30s staleness) so two instances never write one chat at once, and a `chats.rev` counter asserted inside the write transaction so an instance holding a view from before another's changes cannot overwrite them. A rolling `chats.db.bak` (`node:sqlite` `backup()`, refreshed when dirty and on quit) is the real backup; recovery goes damaged DB → backup → archive.

The legacy `chats/<id>.json` files are imported once and then **never written, moved, or deleted** — so `rm chats.db` rolls back to the pre-migration corpus. They are an *archive, not a live backup*: they stop tracking reality the moment the migration lands. See `store.ts` for the corruption path (salvage the readable rows first, fall back to the archive only if nothing survives).

### Renderer state (`src/renderer/src/store.ts`)

Only the active chat's messages are held in memory, and only the window main sent — `messages` is the loaded suffix and `hiddenBefore` counts what is still in the database. Switching chats refetches via `getChat`; the "Load earlier messages" control at the top of `ChatView` prepends the next window and restores the reading position by anchoring on distance from the *bottom* of the scroller, which is the part a prepend does not move. Events for non-active chats still update sidebar metadata and statuses. The right panel hosts file tabs, git diff tabs (tab ids prefixed `diff:`), and the plan panel; an `ExitPlanMode` permission request auto-opens the plan panel. When a chat's status returns to `idle`, open files, the file tree, and git status are refreshed so the agent's edits show up.

### The task checklist (`lib/taskList.ts`, `TodoCard`)

One card, two completely different provider shapes. Codex sends `TodoWrite`,
where a single call carries the whole list and the card is just a render of
`input.todos`. Claude Code replaced that tool with an incremental API —
`TaskCreate` one task at a time, `TaskUpdate` to flip a status — so **no single
call holds the list** and it has to be folded out of the transcript. `TodoCard`
therefore takes the list, not the tool part.

Three things about the fold, each measured against the real corpus rather than
assumed:

- **The id exists only in the output.** `TaskCreate`'s *input* has no id; it
  comes back in the result (`Task #3 created successfully: …`), and that string
  is the only thing a later `TaskUpdate` can be matched against.
- **It is never message-local.** Each API response carries at most one of these
  calls, so a `TaskUpdate` is never in the same assistant message as its
  `TaskCreate` — across 366 real updates, not once. Folding per message would
  render an empty list every time; the fold spans the whole loaded window.
- **A run collapses to one card.** A five-task plan arrives as five back-to-back
  `TaskCreate`s, which would stutter "0/1, 0/2, 0/3…" — 566 real calls for 255
  runs, i.e. over half the cards saying nothing. Only the last call of a run
  draws, showing the list once it settled; any other rendered content between
  two calls ends the run. Superseded calls are dropped in `AssistantBlock`
  rather than rendered as null, because Claude Code puts one call in a message
  and an empty block is still a flex item in the message list — the gap
  `isBlankMsg` exists to prevent.

A call with no folded list falls back to an ordinary tool card: it either failed
(the list didn't change, so claiming otherwise would be a lie) or it only moved
a task created before the loaded window, which nothing on screen can name.
`Task{Stop,Output,Get}` are a *different* feature — background agents, keyed by
a snake_case `task_id` hash rather than the checklist's numeric `taskId` — and
are deliberately not folded in.

The fold and the live-card id live in `taskListStore`, outside the message
history render path, for the reason that store already existed: both churn
several times a second mid-turn, and threading them through props would
re-render every transcript row on each flip. That only works because
`reconcileSnapshots` carries unchanged lists forward *by identity* — a fresh
array per fold would defeat the whole arrangement.

### File icons (`lib/fileIcon.tsx`)

One filename → icon map behind every place the app names a file: the tree,
editor tabs, ⌘P, @-mentions, composer attachments. **Shape says what kind of
thing a file is, color says which language** — an image, an archive, a lockfile,
a key and a stylesheet each get their own silhouette, while the twenty-odd
source languages share `FileCode` and are told apart by hue. That split is the
whole design: at 14px a column of distinct silhouettes reads as static, where
one silhouette in seven colors reads as a sorted list. The exceptions are marks
more recognisable than any color (React's orbit, Rust's gear, Java's cup) and
`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`, which get their provider's own `ProviderMark`.

Colors come from `--icon-*` (`index.css`), a seven-hue palette stepped per mode
— *not* real brand hues, which are picked for marketing pages and half of which
are illegible or shouty against one of the two chat surfaces. Distinct again
from `--brand-*` (a fact about a logo) and `--chart-*` (series identity): here
color is only a grouping, and no icon may out-shout the filename beside it.

The tree also carries git: a changed file's *name* takes its status color
(`lib/gitStatusColor.ts`, shared with the review panel's status column, since a
file that is amber in one list and green in the other is worse than no color at
all), and a **collapsed** folder holding changes gets an amber dot — the one
place a change would otherwise be invisible. Repo-relative paths are joined onto
the tree root exactly as `openDiff` does it.

### Sidebar modes (`Sidebar.tsx`, `SidebarDensity`)

The sidebar has two shapes, chosen in Settings → Chats and persisted in
`localStorage`. They are not two skins of one list — the row format and the
organising principle change together, because each only makes sense with the
other:

- **Compact** — one line per chat, **grouped by project**, collapsible, ordered
  by the user's saved project order.
- **Detailed** — provider mark, title, and a second line naming the project and
  branch (or the folder path, outside a repo) — in one **flat, newest-first
  list** bucketed by date. Grouping by project here would print the same folder,
  and in a repo where nothing is isolated the same branch, once per row; the
  date buckets structure the list by what actually varies down it. "Today" goes
  unlabelled — the top of a newest-first list is today by definition.

**The order is the array, and the array moves once per turn.** `chats` in the
renderer store is held *in sidebar order*: seeded newest-first by `listChats`,
then mutated only when a chat is created, deleted, or **starts a turn**
(`hoistChat` — to the front, timestamp bumped with it so a row can't sit above a
newer one carrying an older date bucket). Re-sorting on `updatedAt` as messages
arrived meant a running turn reordered the sidebar several times a second, and
two streaming chats simply traded places forever. Compact mode hid most of it —
a bump only shuffled within a project, and the project order was already
pinned — but detailed mode is one flat list, so every bump crossed the whole
sidebar. `updatedAt` still tracks the last message: it is what a row's timestamp
shows and how the next launch seeds the order. It just no longer decides
position while you're looking at it.

The **project filter** (`All projects ▾`) heads the list in **both** modes. It
was detailed-only at first, on the reasoning that compact's project rows already
are the filter — but "show me one project" is not a question only a flat list
asks, and compact's answer to it was collapsing the other nine rows by hand. The
two modes were also already sharing the state: `sidebarProject` persists, and
the Pinned section scopes off it either way, so a filter set in detailed used to
quietly scope compact's pins with no control on screen to clear it. It is a
control, not the section label it replaced, so it is sized like the chat titles
below it rather than like a divider.

**A filtered compact list drops its project row.** The header already names the
project; a row repeating it 30px lower is the sidebar saying it twice, its
collapse toggle would empty the sidebar, and its drag handle has nothing to
trade places with. The two things it does carry — "New chat here" and the
project actions (rename/reveal/archive/hide/delete) — move onto the chat rows'
right-click menu via `projectMenu`, which is the mechanism detailed mode already
uses for having no project rows either; the chats then sit flush, since the
indent was that row's hanging indent. `projectMenuItems` is the single
definition all three sites render.

**Starting a chat asks which project** (`NewChatDialog`, `newChatOpen`) — the
sidebar's New chat row and ⌘N both open it, in both modes. That question was
always there and never asked: a new chat landed in whatever folder happened to
be selected, which is invisible state, and compact mode's per-project ＋ was the
only place the answer was ever explicit. The dialog is the same palette shape as
the chat search, ordered by *recency* rather than the sidebar's manual project
order, so ⌘N-Enter is the common case. The instant paths survive where the
project is already on screen: compact's per-project ＋, and "New chat here" on a
detailed row's menu.

That dialog is also where projects get **pruned**, because it is the only place
the whole list appears as rows — detailed mode has no project rows, so removal
otherwise means hunting for a chat that happens to belong to the project you
want gone. A ✕ on the selected row (⌘⌫ from the keyboard) hands off to the same
confirm the sidebar menu opens; a palette where Enter starts a chat has no
business deleting on one click. Rows whose folder no longer exists are tagged
`missing` — one `statPath` each, on open rather than in the store, since a
folder can vanish between two openings — and typing "missing" filters to exactly
that set, which is the state the list is usually opened in.

Per-chat branches come from `git:branches` → `branchesAt` (`git.ts`), which
reads `.git/HEAD` directly rather than spawning `rev-parse` per row, and follows
a worktree's `.git` *pointer file* so a worktree reports its own branch. The
read is skipped entirely in compact mode (`refreshChatBranches` guards on the
density), and refreshes when the folder set changes or any chat's turn ends —
any chat, not just the active one, since a turn can create a branch.

`--brand-claude` / `--brand-codex` (`index.css`) color the provider marks and are
**not** `--chart-claude` / `--chart-codex`. The chart pair are *assigned* hues, a
legend for two series, free to be warm/cool because a chart's colors only have to
be told apart. A logo's color is a fact about the brand: Claude's is that orange,
OpenAI's mark is monochrome (so it flips near-black → near-white by mode), and a
blue Codex badge would be wrong however well it paired.

### Usage (`src/main/usageScan.ts`, `usageStats.ts`, `components/UsageStats.tsx`)

Two different questions wear the word "usage", and they share nothing. `usage.ts`
+ `UsagePanel` ask the providers **how much plan headroom is left right now** —
answered live, off a throwaway process, shown as a chip in the sidebar footer.
`usageStats.ts` + the Usage **page** ask **what was spent, on what, over the last
7/30/90 days** — a history question no live API answers, since neither provider
bills a subscription per token.

The only durable record is the CLIs' own session logs, so that is the source:
`~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<session>.jsonl` and
`~/.codex/sessions/<y>/<m>/<d>/rollout-*.jsonl`. Reading them covers Carbon's own
turns *for free* — both SDKs drive the real CLIs, so an in-app chat lands in the
same files as a terminal one. That is also why the page does **not** also sum the
`TurnStats` on our own event messages: it would double every in-app turn.

- **Subagents are separate files.** A Task/subagent turn is written to
  `<session>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl` (and one level deeper under
  `subagents/workflows/<id>/`), sharing no message ids with the parent and leaving
  no `isSidechain` copy in it. Stopping the directory walk at the session file
  silently omitted ~16% of spend, which is why `collectJsonl` descends 6 levels.
- **Dedupe is per file, on `message.id` + `requestId`.** One API response is
  written once per content block, so a turn with text *and* a tool call appears
  twice carrying identical usage.
- **Codex reports a running total and a per-call delta** on `token_count` events,
  and no model — hence `CodexFileReader`, a per-file cursor that carries the model
  forward from `turn_context` / `thread_settings_applied` and sums only the delta.
  Its `input_tokens` is *inclusive* of `cached_input_tokens`; Claude's is not.
- **Rates are fetched, not hard-coded** (`usageRates.ts`). A static table cannot
  price the Codex-only slugs: `gpt-5.6-sol` bills at $5/$30 per MTok, 4× the
  GPT-5 family it is named after, and guessing the family understated Codex spend
  by ~4×. They come from LiteLLM's public `model_prices_and_context_window.json`
  — the feed `ccusage` prices against — cached 24h in `userData/usage-rates.json`,
  fetched only when the page is opened. The built-in table in `usageScan.ts` is
  the fallback, not the source: it answers before the first fetch and forever if
  the fetch never lands, and an id the feed doesn't know falls through to it and
  then to being reported unpriced rather than silently free.
- **The 1-hour cache-write rate is applied** (2× input vs 1.25× for 5-minute).
  Claude Code writes 1-hour caches almost exclusively and they run to ~170M
  tokens a month, so collapsing the two TTLs understates Claude by ~8%. Fast mode
  is likewise a different SKU rather than a faster tier — `usage.speed` says which
  served the turn, and it is part of the cell key for exactly that reason.
- **Nothing is read twice, and cells hold tokens rather than money.** Each file
  reduces to a few `(model, speed, day)` cells cached under `(path, mtime, size)`
  in `userData/usage-cache.json`; session logs are append-only, so an unchanged
  stamp means unchanged content. Cost is applied at *read* time (`priceCell`) —
  a cell that stored dollars would freeze one day's rates into a file that never
  changes again and therefore never gets re-read, which is precisely the bug a
  refreshing rate feed would otherwise introduce. A cold scan is ~2 GB and ~5 s,
  a warm one ~20 ms, and switching range never re-reads. `CACHE_VERSION` now
  tracks only the *parsing* — rate changes reprice for free.

`--chart-claude` / `--chart-codex` (`index.css`) are the one place the app carries
hue a theme does not set: on a page whose job is "Claude vs Codex" the colors *are*
the labels, so they must not move when the theme does. Warm/cool, and validated for
CVD separation and contrast in both modes — they are not interchangeable with
`--warning` / `--success`, which mean state rather than identity.

### Git worktrees (`src/main/worktree.ts`)

A chat can run in an isolated worktree. **The app creates the worktree itself** (`git worktree add`) rather than delegating to Claude Code's `.claude/worktrees/` or Codex's equivalent — a worktree is just a directory, so owning creation is what makes the feature provider-neutral. `chat.cwd` points at the worktree and `chat.worktree` carries the metadata (`repoRoot`, `branch`); **the provider adapters are untouched**, since both already take `chat.cwd`. Preserve that property: cwd is the only seam.

The entry point is a Cursor-style "Run on" chip **above** the composer (`WorktreePicker.tsx`) — This Mac / an existing worktree / New worktree — paired with a branch chip that tracks the selection. It sits above the composer deliberately: the composer's own controls row (model, effort, permission mode) is already tight.

Worktrees live in `~/.karbun/worktrees/<repo>-<hash>/<branch>` (outside the repo so they never dirty git status, outside `userData` whose path contains a space that breaks build scripts). `KARBUN_WORKTREES_DIR` overrides the root — tests set it so they don't write to a real `$HOME`.

A fresh worktree has no gitignored files (`node_modules`, `.env`). Like Claude Code and Codex, we don't copy them: the project ships a committed `.karbun/setup.sh` (falling back to Codex's `.codex/setup.sh`, with `CODEX_WORKDIR` exported), run in a visible terminal tab on creation. It is deliberately not awaited — the agent starts while the install races alongside it.

Removal mirrors Claude Code: unforced `git worktree remove` + `branch -d`, so git itself refuses to destroy uncommitted or unmerged work; the confirm dialog reports what's at risk and only then offers a force. A worktree shared by more than one chat is never removed with one of them.

Because everything is cwd-parameterized, the existing GitPanel ladder (commit → push → `gh pr create`) already works from inside a worktree.

The environment is chosen at chat start and only *displayed* afterwards (the read-only folder/branch pill in `ContextStrip` — same convention as Cursor and the Codex app). Mid-chat actions live where they're used: the diff chip opens the review, whose GitPanel dock carries the `resolveGitActions` ladder, and the chat's ⋯ menu carries the worktree lifecycle — everything you can do to a worktree once it exists:

- **Update from main** — a delegated `resolveGitActions` rung (`update-from-main`), not an app-executed merge, *because* of conflicts: the point of updating early is having the agent resolve them here rather than at landing time. It runs in the chat's own cwd, so it needs no sandbox concessions and is offered to any chat on a non-default branch, worktree or not — both go stale against main the same way.
- **Merge into main** — the ending for work that never becomes a PR, offered from any chat that isn't already on the default branch. One menu item, two implementations, because from the user's side it is one thing ("put this in main") and what differs is only whose directory changes. A worktree chat runs `mergeWorktree`: merge into the default branch in `repoRoot`, then remove the worktree and branch. The app executes this one itself because the merge must happen in `repoRoot`, outside the agent's cwd and Codex's sandbox. A plain chat runs `gitMergeIntoDefault`, which switches, merges and deletes the branch *in the chat's own directory* — so it's offered only while the chat is idle, and the dialog says the folder is about to change. Both refuse on a dirty tree and undo a conflicting merge (restoring the original branch), so a refusal always leaves the directory exactly as it was found. Both also end **on** the default branch, which is safe precisely because `resolveGitActions`' first rung from there is "Create Branch & Commit" — the next piece of work branches off again instead of piling onto main.
- **Continue in local checkout** (`handOffWorktree`) — remove the worktree and check its branch out in `repoRoot`; order is forced, since git won't check out a branch another worktree holds. Refuses while dirty, because removal would take uncommitted work with it.
- **Remove worktree** (`finishWorktree`) — the *pull request* ending, where the merge already happened on the remote and only cleanup is left: drop the worktree and branch, move the chat to `repoRoot`. This exists because `sync-cleanup`, the ladder's equivalent for a plain checkout, switches to the default branch — which git refuses inside a worktree, since the main checkout holds it. `resolveGitActions` therefore takes `opts.worktree` and offers no rung at all for a merged PR there. The branch deletion is allowed to fail without failing the operation: a squash-merged PR leaves commits git can't see in the default branch, so `-d` refuses even though the work is safely merged — and by then the worktree is gone, so the chat must move regardless.

Both exits relocate the chat, so main disposes the session and the next send respawns in the new cwd — the same reason an effort change disposes.

`branchVsDefault` (git.ts) is the *single* implementation of "where does this branch stand vs main" — one `for-each-ref` + one `rev-list --left-right`. `gitStatus` puts its answer on `GitStatus.defaultBranch` / `behindDefault` / `aheadDefault` (started before the numstat reads so it overlaps them instead of adding a round trip); `worktreeStatus` derives `unmergedCommits` from the same call; the merge guards read it directly. Everything user-facing — the `↓n` staleness chip in `ContextStrip` (click runs "Update from main"), the ⋯ menu labels, the merge dialog's counts — reads the `GitStatus` copy, so the chip, the menu and the dialog can never disagree. Staleness has no other symptom until it surfaces as a conflicted merge, which is why the chip says it out loud while it's still cheap to fix. Note `behindDefault` is *not* `GitStatus.behind`, which is measured against the branch's own upstream. `listWorktrees` tags each ref `merged` from a single `branch --merged`, which is what lets the picker mark a finished worktree and offer to remove it instead of accumulating dead ones. A fresh worktree with no setup script also says so in the chat (`setupMissingFor`); the silence used to read as "installed", and the agent would just start failing on missing dependencies.

## Provider integration

Keep provider behavior behind `AgentSession` and normalize it into `ChatEvent`. Claude has native per-tool permissions and `ExitPlanMode`; Codex maps permission choices to sandbox policies and synthesizes the same plan-review event so the renderer remains provider-neutral.

A chat can switch provider mid-conversation (the composer's model picker offers both providers). A cross-provider pick is **deferred**: it only arms `chat.pendingModel` — the composer previews the target (chip, efforts, placeholder) but nothing else happens, so a misclick is undone by picking again and the original session is never touched. The switch applies on the next send (`applyPendingSwitch` → `switchProvider`): the session is disposed and the conversation carries over by **handoff** (`src/main/handoff.ts` + `ChatManager.handoffContext`) — the outgoing model writes a brief from the app's own transcript on a *throwaway* one-shot, falling back to the raw capped transcript on failure or timeout. The brief rides that same turn via `AgentSession.send`'s `hiddenContext` parameter — prepended to the prompt the model sees, never to the displayed/persisted user message — and may be a *promise*: the echo lands instantly and each session's internal `sendChain` holds turns in order until the context resolves. The plan review's "Build with" picker crosses providers too (this one applies at Approve, which is already deliberate): `ChatManager.approvePlanCrossProvider` tears down the review (disposing the plan session resolves it), restores the pre-plan permission mode, runs `switchProvider`, and kicks off implementation with the plan text verbatim — the plan itself is the handoff artifact; the brief only covers the conversation around it.

A plan approval may carry a `model` (`PermissionDecision`) — the plan review's "Build with" picker — so one model can plan and another implement, Cursor-style. Within a provider, each session applies it at approval time: Claude fires the live `setModel` *before* resolving the approval (both ride the CLI's stdin, so ordering guarantees the implementation turn starts on the new model); Codex sets `chat.model` before building the implementation turn, which snapshots it. A model from the *other* provider never reaches the session — the manager intercepts it (see the handoff paragraph above).

**The model decides the backend, and it is stored twice.** Every place that
remembers a model remembers a provider beside it (`chat.provider`,
`AppDefaults.modelProvider`, `NewChat`'s two `useState`s) — a second field is
unavoidable, because a runtime-discovered id is in no static catalog and only
the picker knows which list it came from. Two fields drift, and this pair drifts
in a way that has no symptom until a send: a chat launched as Codex carrying
`claude-fable-5[1m]` fails every turn with *"The 'claude-fable-5[1m]' model is
not supported when using Codex with a ChatGPT account"*, permanently, because
nothing revisits the pair. So `providerForRememberedModel` is the single
reconciler and the precedence is fixed — a model whose provider is *certain*
outranks the recorded one, which answers only for ids nothing can place.
Certainty comes from the live catalog, then the static one, then the id's shape
(`knownProviderForModel`), that last rule existing because the SDK's wire ids
(`claude-opus-5[1m]`) appear in no catalog at all. Mirroring one field without
the other is the bug this prevents: the renderer copied `defaults.model` after
each new chat and left `modelProvider` behind, so the *next* New-chat screen
paired a fresh Claude pick with the previous chat's Codex provider. Reconcile
where the pair is frozen (`chats:create`), and drop a model the chat's provider
cannot run at send (`dropForeignModel`) so a chat already written that way heals
instead of failing forever.

Codex's `workspace-write` sandbox carves `.git` out as read-only, and it resolves a worktree's `.git` *pointer file* to the shared gitdir and carves that out too — so a worktree creates no Claude/Codex asymmetry that a plain checkout doesn't already have. If that ever changes, the escape hatch is `additionalDirectories` on the SDK's `ThreadOptions` (forwarded as `--add-dir`).
